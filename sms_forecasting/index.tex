% This applied Research project is an web based application using oracle database 11g and oracle forms 10g that defines \textbf{Purchase Requisition Management System of Southeast University}. The idea is to establish a strong communication between employees and authority in order to optimize time and effort and completing the procurement process efficiently and stay organized. Here, employees can place an requisition for an item according to their demands. An approver can give approvals for specific requisition item with proper resources all in one place. Buyer then place order for that item and create schedules. Then receiver create receive list and items against the order schedules. In manual purchasing process, it is often difficult for organizations to identify the gaps and opportunities to save cost, time, resources. Security is a big issue in a business process. The safety of this project has been of paramount importance. A specific user with proper role can access the specified information. The system is able to help employees and authorities to the next era.

% What is Purchase Management System ?

\subsection*{}

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of SMS traffic and balance availability for a specific set of clients, with a particular focus on predicting potential service interruptions during holidays. By employing advanced machine learning techniques, such as \textbf{polynomial regression}, we aim to accurately forecast future SMS traffic and balance levels, enabling clients to optimize their usage and avoid unexpected service disruptions. 

By leveraging advanced data analytics, this study provides a comprehensive forecast of SMS traffic and balance levels, enabling organizations to proactively manage their client communication strategies and resource allocation. This predictive model accurately anticipates SMS traffic during peak periods, such as holidays, and offers hourly updates on balance levels for the next two days, ensuring a seamless and uninterrupted service experience for clients.

Ultimately, this research contributes to the field of machine learning applications and provides practical solutions for organizations seeking to effectively manage their SMS balance allocation to clients, particularly during peak demand periods like holidays.

%\section{Purpose}
%\section{Method}
% \section{Motivation}
% In Southeast University's current existing purchase management system is a manual system. In here, if a requisitioner creates a requisition for an item, requisitioner can't track the requisition status and can't track which stage it is currently positioned. For transferring files desk to desk it takes a long time for processing the approvals for that requisition. A requisitioner can't even find out right away which approver when and why authorized the approval, modified prices, commented for that requisition item. Southeast University doesn't have any current software system to maintain purchasing process and didn't take any further step to make this kind of software before. SEU authority didn't fund for this type of software project before. If a system like this can be developed it will be very helpful to procurement authorities.



% \section{Project scope}
% Using this software a user can create requisition and can send it for approval throughout the software. Using this automated system time is being reduced at high level. This system is with the aim of providing high efficiency, effective control of time, labor and cost savings to its user in their purchasing activities. If a requisitioner needs an item immediately he can add note in the requisition item and send it for approval immediately and it can be approved right way by the approvers because all information are gathered here in one place. An approver don't have to call multiple places to confirm the validation of the information that has been added in the requisition item.





% \section{Purpose}
% The purpose of this software is to serve SEU procurement authorities, employees, lecturers and all other personals to avoid wasting of times and efforts and do procurement process more efficiently in this online system instead of a manual outdated purchase management system.

% \section{Courses and goals}

% \subsection{General Purpose}
% This software enables the requisition generation, approval, rejection, tracking the stage requisition currently located in, purchase order generation and a rapid increase of purchase orders functionality . But in a manual outdated system those functionalities are off limit. It has effective notification system so that a requisitioner can find which approver and when approved or rejected the requisition items and why. A requisitioner doesn't have to wait for a long time for the status of that requisition and requisitioner can view in which stage the requisition is currently positioned and which approver did or didn't give the approvals.

% \subsection{Subject matter}
% \subsection{The locale of the study}
% The data has been gathered from numerous sources. Purchase manual of southeast university has been collected to gather data for this project. Some printed documents also has been collected and categorized for the study to understand procurement process in real life. The study has been conducted in southeast university.

% \subsection{The period of the study}
% For data collection and implementation of the project it took 4 months times. But the project isn't completed yet. It needs atleast one year for completing the whole project.

There are several ERP based system has been developed by many organizations including purchasing modules. Some are very expensive and huge resources and huge man powers are needed to make such environment fit for the organization, which most of the cases organizations don't have. Oracle E-Business Suite is one of them. Each and every organizations requires their own types of system which often requires a customized solution. Oracle E-Business Suite gives purchase module gives a whole customized solutions as per as southeast university procurement policy requires in daily basis. Requirements like requisition generations, requisition management, managing requisition item approval and notification systems, role wise access of the users to avoid unauthorized information, purchase order generations, order item receiving, supplier management, tender management, vendor management, automatic database backup system and so on can be solved by Oracle E-Business Suite's purchase module.\cite{purchase_module_book} \label{sec:purchase_module_book_1}\\


%Though southeast university doesn't have any software system for that and often requires a project like this to maintain and process the huge data it is currently dealing with . The main focus of this project is to gives a customized solution as per as southeast university procurement policy requires in daily basis. This project solves the requisition generations, requisition management, managing requisition item approval and notification systems, role wise access of the users to avoid unauthorized information, purchase order generations, order item receiving, supplier management, automatic database backup system and so on. The system can reduce cost in different ways such as can avoid unnecessary items by tracking the purchases all in one place. The scope of this review is limited by the availability of literature and time. As a broad study, it does not present the full range of literature on the state of SEU Purchase requisition Management System. But gives an overview of the main concerns and areas for improvement. \\




Building a project like purchase management system by Oracle Forms can be more reliable, robust and efficient. It isn't just about data-entry into an Oracle database any more. Oracle Forms can get the job done that modern applications requires. Powerful desktop applications delivered with the easy and scalability of a web applications. An old technology but widely used in Oracle ERP. it's simple and fast but anybody can develop the way they want. It's originally developed to run on server-side. By using Oracle Forms creating graphical user interface is more easy and with the use of PL/SQL code it becomes more reliable. \cite{form_builder_book}  \label{sec:form_builder_book_1}\\


Oracle Database 11g deliver the highest quality of service in terms of manageability, high availability, and performance. It has capabilities to use and manage all the major application development environments such as PL/SQL, Java/JDBC, .NET and Windows, PHP, SQL Developer, and Application Express. It also helps organizations protect their information with unique secure configurations, data encryption and masking, and sophisticated auditing capabilities. \cite{sql_book, sql_book2} \label{sec:sql_book_1}\\


PL/SQL includes procedural language elements like conditions and loops and so on. PL/SQL units like  functions, procedures,  types, packages, and triggers, which are stored in the database level for the purpose of re-usability by applications that uses Oracle Databases. PL/SQL is one of three key programming languages embedded in the Oracle Database, along with SQL itself and Java. It's completely portable, high-performance transaction-processing language and provides a built-in, interpreted and OS independent programming environment,high security level.\cite{plsql_book, plsql_book2}  \label{sec:plsql_book_1}\\



There are three available alternatives for a Forms application nowadays. Doing nothing, Modernize and Migrate. Leaving as it is running Oracle Forms application is not a good idea at all. The java versions, browser versions are continuously updated and users changes operating systems regularly. But Doing nothing at all leaves the systems powerless to these changes, and unless at least upgraded to the latest version of Oracle Forms, even Oracle supports cannot help. \cite{feature_forms}  \label{sec:feature_forms_1}\\

Logging in is a process where an individual access into a secured computer system by entering authentic identification. Here, in this page a authentic user must enter valid username and password to access the main system to perform a task. After successful logging in Home page will be appeared. Which user when access to the system, it will be stored in the database for security purpose. A valid user of course can modify the password and modify his own profile of course.


In, Figure-\ref{fig:login_page} the log-in page has been showed from this project. The user-name and password must be more than or equivalent to 4 characters and should be valid to access the home page. 





\section{Home Form}

A home page  is the initial page of a software application. It is also sometimes called main page as well. In, Figure-\ref{fig:home_page} the Home page has been showed. Any user with authentic username and password can access this page. In this page a user can see all the roles that has been assigned to that user.In this page a menu bar will be showed up in the header area of the page. By using the menu bar the user can go to the specific pages and does the jobs according to the roles.

\section{Requisition Entry Form}
During a Requisition lifecycle, many people can act on the requisition including Employees, Buyers or buyer-planners, Approvers, Suppliers, Purchasing staff or employees. Here a requisition generator creates a requisition who must be a registered user and an employee of SEU of course and must have "Create Requisition" privilege. An employee can create requisition list which can contain multiple requisition items. In the description section a requisition generator can tells if it's urgent or not. In which currency the transactions will be occurred the user can select it using lov that has been assigned to that field. Prepared by and last updated time field will be automatically filled by the system.\\

In each requisition items, there will be information about requisition item id,the requestor's demanded product name (selected by using LOV), the requestor name(selected by using LOV), price of the product, quantity of that product that is required (QTY), total amount(which is automatically calculated, total amount = QTY * price ), supplier site name, need by date, delivery locations and so on. Each item must need all level of approvals before generating purchase order against that requisition item.\\

Here, if the total amount for an item is less than or equal to 3000 then one approval is needed. If item total amount is greater than 3000 and less than or equal to 10,000 then it will need 2 approvals  and if item total amount is greater than 10,000 then it will need 3 approvals. In this way the new rules can be applied. This is an automatic system. One trigger is created to complete this task. The trigger's code is given below. The software developer must maintain the code when the rules will be changed.\\%codes

In Requisition Amount Distribution block there will be multiple records for each requisition items. Each record holds a bank account(suggesting an account to be charged) which is selected by using LOV, expenditure percent can't be more than 100\% then expenditure amount's field will be automatically filled by system calculation.\\

Requisition items roles block is only for view. A used can ad or modify any information here. This page is for requisition creator so that he/she can view which approver and when did or didn't approve the requisition item and for which reason with comments.
In, Figure-\ref{fig:req_list_page} Requisition Entry Form is being showed. Some key things to remember :

\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\alph{enumi})}
\begin{enumerate}

		\item After inserting and saving items in the requisition items block, the items cannont be deleted
		\item Requisitioner has to wait to take it further steps till all the approvals for that item is being approved
		\item Only the user who created the requisition item can access his/her own created item
		\item If the requisition item once saved it cannot be changed by the creator
\end{enumerate}

\section{Requisition Approval List Form}
A user with the role of ``Requisition Approval" can access the form. Requisition items block is only for view. An approver can select one item from here to give approval. In requisition item roles needed block an approver ha to select yes or no in ``is approve?" field. Once all the approval is given as yes by all the approvers then the item will be approved and it connot be changed anymore.
Suppose, if a requisition item needs 3 approvals. If first approver gives approval then second approver can gain power to give approval. Again if second approver gives approvals then third approver can give approval.

\section{Purchase order Form}
To access purchase order form a user must need "Buyer" role. A buyer can create a order and in that order can contain multiple order items. In the Order Entry block the buyer has to fill order type. In this case, order type is standard purchase order. Buyer has to add currency name, supplier name, supplier site by using different lov. Buyer should also add Description and Bill to location in the specific fields. \\

In the order items block, buyer can add multiple order items. Each order items can contains order item id which is automatically generated by the system and buyer shouldn't worry about that. Each order item must be against a unique requisition item. It is strictly restricted by the system. Buyer don't have to worry about that matter. Requisition item id is selected by the buyer using ``Requisition item lov". Then Product name, UOM, price will be automatically filled by the system.\\

Each order item contains multiple shipment schedule if needed. Shipment schedules total qty, and charge amount will not be crossed cause of system automatic restriction. \\

Each shipment schedules contains multiple order distributions. Each distribution contains the bank account, expenditure percent and charge amount.

\section{Receipt Form}
To access the Receipt form a user must have ``Add Receipt" Role. After accessing the receipt form a receiver all he has to do is write the name and select order shipment schedule id by using lov that has been set to that item and and write the received qty. Other than these three things a receiver doesn't have to do anything. It's very simple and all things are generated automatically by the system for more user friendly environment. Receipt date will be automatically set by system. UOM, requestor name, Expected qty and note to receiver will be automatically set. Commenting will be a good practice for future analysis and make the receipt form much more understandable.

This software projects is based on purchase requisition management system using Oracle Forms 10g. In here user creates requisition list which contains requisition item and each of them needs approvals. After being approved, a notification will be sent to the creator of that requisition item by the system automatically and the requisition item can be added as an order item in an order list by a buyer and purchase the item from suppler site. Then items are supplied by vendor and it is received by a receiver and the process ends. The user can made the purchase process in a single platform and don't have to waste time unnecessarily when the system is online. It needs more functionality like tender, auction process, market analyzing and other business processes to make it fully compatible to the SEU purchase requisition management system.


\section*{Limitations and Boundaries}
Limited time, lack of resources and lack of industry level experiences are the main reasons for the limitations and boundaries of this project. Right now this software isn't accessible to everyone. It will be if there is a unique real IP and network configurations can be done. This software will be well designed and well be described to make it more user reliable, robust and user friendly in future implementations. This project requires jdk 6 version which isn't quite appreciable for current time application users but jdk 8 will be used in future implementations. 


\section*{Recommendations on Future Improvement}
\ifx
There is always room for improvements. In this software there are so many other functionalities to add. In future, this project can be implemented in Oracle E-Business Suite or Oracle Application Express or  Oracle Forms 12c to make this project more reliable and more robust and more user friendly and will be added some more business functions. In addition, the software can also be improved in terms of the calculations it can perform, and the rates of flexibility used in calculations per user. If any problem will be generated in the future the developers will try best to solve the issues. 
\fi
There is always room for improvements. In this software there are so many other functionalities to add.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item This project can be implemented in Oracle E-Business Suite or Oracle Application Express or  Oracle Forms 12c to make this project more reliable and more robust
	\item Tender and Auction system can be added to maintain tender process. That part can describe the cost of the contract, submit the best prices, prices are compared to other vendors prices, cooperating about the quality of the goods or services during a specific periods.
	\item Supplier Comparisons in terms of product's quality, price etc. Analyzing the Actual Costs, communicating different providers, Measuring Supply Performances. 
	\item Messaging System : For example, requisitioner wants to reminds the approver by a message to ensure requisition item approval.
	\item Audit : To control risks, prevent fraud, ensure maximum savings and maintain regulatory requirements and maintain periodic audits to avoid unwanted risks. 
	\item Vendor Validation : Analyzing, if the vendor's plays an integral role in the organization, if they follow the guidelines, policies and continue to meet company criteria as SEU required.
	\item Quality Assessment : By continuous checking the reports of the quality once the goods or services are received. Checking inventory reports, patterns of poor or damaged products may lead to review of the vendor's suitability for the organization.
	%\item Inquiries : Analyzing information from a purchase order, 
	
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Contribution}

The purchase requisition management system is a new project in Southeast University. In the past no one worked on this subject. It may be a good solution to help the procurement process undoubtedly. And this is a nonprofit software application.
